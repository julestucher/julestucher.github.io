      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Born and raised in Oakland, Calif., Jules is a genderqueer powerlifter, performer, and data scientist. Currently employed at Mathematica
        Policy Research as a Data Analyst Associate (2021-), they collaborate on multiple ongoing research projects across content areas within 
        Mathematica's Human Services division. Jules excels at a variety of statistical software packages, including R, Python, Tableau, Stata, and
        Microsoft Excel. Their favorite projects target sociopolitical equity questions in education, especially with regards to racial and gender 
        representation.
      <p>Jules graduated cum laude from Williams College in June 2021. They enjoyed taking full advantage of the liberal arts college model, exploring classes outside the Mathematics and Computer Science majors, particularly
        in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies; Theatre; and Psychology. Within major curricula, Jules benefitted from close relationships
        with professors, some of whom supported independent and collaborative research. In computer science, they have expanded her theoretical
        knowledge while developing a broad range of technical skills. In math, they discovered the beauty of algebra, the joys of applications,
        and the complexities of real analysis.
      </p>
      <p>Jules's favorite skills include data graphics and vizualizations projects in R. They completed an honors thesis in mathematics as the
        capstone of their undergraduate career, exploring an original measure for teacher-student race match and comparing the
        metric across California public schools. An aspiring data scientist and math modeler, Jules's research and applications of
        quantitative skills are strongly motivated by issues in equity and inclusion, using computation for social good.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of classes, Jules took to the stage in department and student-led theatre productions. They enjoyed the company of their
        improv group–Treestyle–and cooking dinner with friends. Their favorite college experience, though, was servig as a Junior Advisor (JA)
        to the Class of 2023 and advising the JAs to the Class of 2024 while in a position on JA Advisory Board (JAAB). These days, you can find
        them in the weight room training for future powerlifting meets. Jules uses they/them pronouns.
